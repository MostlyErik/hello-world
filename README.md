# hello-world
In this repository, you can find the "first steps" in the web-development of one Far-East guy. I think that you will find in here my attempts of use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python + Django. So my code-way starts from here. Hello, World!
Also i'm a student of college and I'm taking a course in FarEast Python Community.
